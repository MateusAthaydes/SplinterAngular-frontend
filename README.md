# SplinterAngularFront
Frontend in angular for Splinter project

To install the project you'll need Node and NPM installed,
after that I recommend you install:
bower: ```npm install -g bower```
and also grunt ```npm install -g grunt-cli```

After that, clone this repository and into it's folder, run:
```npm install```
```bower install```

To test if it works, execute:
```grunt serve```

It should have started the server, go to your browser and open access: localhost:9000

Well done!
